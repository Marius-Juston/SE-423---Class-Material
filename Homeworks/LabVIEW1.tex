\Ex[Temperature]

Read through at least the first two sections at the site \url{http://www.ni.com/gettingstarted/labviewbasics} \textit{LABVIEW Environment Basics and Dataflow Programming Basics} and watch at least the first two videos and the tenth video at the site \url{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB968815D7BB78F9C}

Reproduce (does not have to be exactly the same) the Fahrenheit to Celsius LABVIEW program that \textbf{uses a loop structure} to continuously run until a Stop button is pressed. Add some bells and whistles if you would like.

\Ex[Sequence Structures]

Read through all 12 sections at the site \url{http://www.ni.com/gettingstarted/labviewbasics} and watch the first 10 videos at the site \url{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB968815D7BB78F9C}.

You can find other good YouTube videos. Here are a few others I found to get you started
\begin{itemize}
    \item \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em5R_RM8E08}
    \item \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bflByHG5jdc}
    \item \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ea2IQeCIMY}
    \item \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxoJljThkKk}
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, watch the YouTube video below that introduces sequence structures: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjN5Fpsjwng}.

To give you an introduction to sequence structures, reproduce the VI demonstrated in the YouTube video \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03PykG1O1x0}. You may need to find online help on “Case structures” as they are used in this video, but are not explained.

\Ex[Event Structures]

To give you an introduction to event structures, reproduce the VI demonstrated in the YouTube video \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eO64fo3Pho}. You do not need to demonstrate the initial “polling” VI. Just the event structure VI.

\Ex[Multi-dimensional array]

Read through the Array and Clusters Tutorial at \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzOT1zXBDiE} and
\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlQ1riWjPc&list=PLB968815D7BB78F9C}. Then reproduce the following exercises. See how a “for loop” can create a multidimensional array and use the Index Array to pull out a single row, a single column, and a single element. Sine is found under Mathematics$\rightarrow$Elementary$\rightarrow$Trig

\Ex[Cluster]

Create a Cluster and then produce two Clusters similar to the first.
